## ⚙️ How It Works

1.  The user enters a city name in the search bar.
2.  JavaScript captures the input and makes an API call to a weather service (e.g., OpenWeatherMap API) with the city name.
3.  The API returns weather data in JSON format.
4.  JavaScript parses this data and dynamically updates the HTML to display the current temperature, weather condition, humidity, wind speed, etc. for the searched city.
